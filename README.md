# CMS-laravel-elmapi
Elmapi is a self-hosted headless CMS built with Laravel and VueJs. It provides a clean and easy to use interface and a powerful Content API.

A headless CMS is a backend-only content management system that makes content accessible via an API. A traditional CMS typically combines the content and frontend of a website. Headless CMS is a decoupled system that comprises just the content component and focuses entirely on the administrative interface. One advantage of this decoupled approach is that content can be sent via APIs to multiple display types, like mobile and Internet of Things (IoT) devices, alongside a website.
